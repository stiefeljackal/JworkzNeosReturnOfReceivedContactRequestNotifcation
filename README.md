# Return of Received Contact Request Notifcation (JworkzNeosReturnOfReceivedContactRequestNotifcation)

Long ago, there was a feature in Neos where when one sends a contact request to another person, a purple notification would appear on the requetee's
end as long as the requestee was in VR. Due to an update, this feature was lost in the buggy abyss to never be seen again... until now.

If you haven't caught on, this mod address a bug in Neos where contact request notifications are not being sent.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/stiefeljackal/JworkzNeosReturnOfReceivedContactRequestNotifcation).
2. Place [JworkzNeosReturnOfReceivedContactRequestNotifcation.dll](https://github.com/stiefeljackal/JworkzNeosReturnOfReceivedContactRequestNotifcation/releases/latest/download/JworkzNeosReturnOfReceivedContactRequestNotifcation.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
